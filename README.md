w# Deep Learning Methods for Classify Cyber Attacks on CPS

This repository contains the final project for the **Deep Learning** course at the **Universidad de Concepción**.

The goal of this project is to classify and analyze cyberattacks—specifically **False Data Injection (FDI)** and **Denial of Service (DoS)**—injected and random variants into real industrial data from **Huachipato's boiler** system.

We explore and compare the performance of different deep learning architectures using PyTorch:

- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **1D Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
- **Autoencoder (AE)**

---

## Objectives

- Simulate realistic cyberattacks on real process data
- Train and evaluate deep learning models for attack detection
- Compare model performance across different types of attacks and architectures

---

## Attacks Simulated

- **FDI (False Data Injection)** – deterministic and random variation
- **DoS (Denial of Service)** – deterministic and random variation

---

Feel free to explore the code, replicate the experiments, and suggest improvements!
